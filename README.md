This is a coding test performed by Kevin Salicos, 2/10/2021.

Notes:
I chose to work in .Net 5, which I hadn't used extensively yet. This caused a slight delay as some configuration was not complete, or was different from my previous environment.  I took some time to activate runtime compilation, for example.

The template did not render as I expected. The AC mentioned two known issues:

 - Content overflows from lists into footer causes list content to render underneath the footer rather than pushing the footer down.
 - Three column layout causes issues on mobile.
 
However, my experience was that accounts would render overlapping, and padding was wildly off. I decided not to address this due to timeboxing.
